The code files ListTableCreate and UserTableCreate are query codes that, when executed, create and format the tables that will store our user data.
The code files ListTableInsert and UserTableInsert are query codes that, when executed, read the .txt files for data and insert them into the properly formatted tables.
The ListTableInsert and UserTableInsert can use ListingTest.txt and UserTest.txt to create test tables. (The path URL needs to be updated to the URL location of said .txt files)
These query files run automatically through programs called agents that update periodically, on server activation.
The search function takes in a user input in the SQL will then sort the database to the most relevant match.
