Created SQLMD databases for users and listings
- Issue connecting temp data text file (usersTestFile.txt) for database (can not bulk load data to SQL) due to access denial
	- give access to folder that txt was in, but did not fix access error 5
	- give even more permission to allow SQL systems to read, but did not fix access error 5
	- add two SQL accounts, but did not fix access error 5
	- modified document URL, but new error 
		- Resources searched for helped StackOverflow.com, Youtube.com
- Issue sorta resolved | issue is not found on LUIS SQL database, no idea why
	-issues un-recreateable on LUIS SQLMS
	-Could not find issue for main database moving to test database on UIS SQL

Sent over SQLMD database code to Luis computer 
Changes column limiters to ';' \\ may need to change this later
Changed listing table to handle multiply listing instrument preferences through increasing column count to 10 
Created nuke query for test table clearing
- Issue when creating inserting preference data, column fills with the next listings data if all previous data columns 	aren't filled
