Created SQLMD databases for users and listings
- Issue connecting temp data text file (usersTestFile.txt) for database (can not bulk load data to SQL) due to access denial
	- give access to the folder that the txt was in, but did not fix the access error 5
	- give even more permission to allow SQL systems to read, but did not fix the access error 5
	- add two SQL accounts, but did not fix the access error 5
	- modified document URL, but new error 
		- Resources searched for included StackOverflow.com, Youtube.com
- Issue sorta resolved | issue is not found on LUIS SQL database, no idea why
	-issues un-recreateable on LUIS SQLMS
	-Could not find issue for main database, moving to test database on UIS SQL

Sent over SQLMD database code to Luis' computer 
Changes column limiters to ';' \\ may need to change this later
Changed listing table to handle multiple listing instrument preferences by increasing the column count to 10 
Created a nuke query for the test table clearing
- Issue when creating or inserting preference data, the column fills with the next listing's data if all previous data columns 	aren't filled
